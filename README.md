This repository contains code to define the NFW dark matter density profile

Method: Analyze dark matter particle data from simulations of ultrafaint dwarfs in Jeon+2021, 2017 to determine the best fit dark matter density profile.

Goal: Determine if the dark matter density profile changes as a function of : SNe energy, inclusion of radiative transport, halo mass, SF history

Step One:

Clone this Repo.

Create a Jupyter Notebook (with Anaconda).  This is a test code. 

Commit the code to the repo.

Get used to commands: 
git pull
git status
git add 
git commit -m " COMMENT HERE "
git push





Step Two: 

In the new Jupyter Notebook, import the NFW.py code 

Use NFW.py to determine the scale length, virial radius and virial concentration for a halo of mass 1e9.


Step Three:

In the Jupyter Notebook, plot the NFW density profile for a halo with virial mass 10^9 Msun. 

Determine the scaling behavior of the  density profile with radius:  at r<< r_s or r>> r_s (see NFW.png)

Change the virial concentration - what happens to the density profile?  

Change the virial mass - what happens to the density profile?
