This repository contains code to define the NFW dark matter density profile

Method: Analyze dark matter particle data from simulations of ultrafaint dwarfs in Jeon+2021, 2017 to determine the best fit dark matter density profile.

Goal: Destermine if the dark matter density profile changes as a function of : SNe energy, inclusion of radiative transport, halo mass, SF history
