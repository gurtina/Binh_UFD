This repository contains code to define the NFW dark matter density profile

Method: Analyze dark matter particle data from simulations of ultrafaint dwarfs in Jeon+2021, 2017 to determine the best fit dark matter density profile.

Goal: Determine if the dark matter density profile changes as a function of : SNe energy, inclusion of radiative transport, halo mass, SF history

Step 1: 

Use the NFW.py code to plot the density profile for a halo with virial mass 10^9 Msun. 
Determine the scale length, virial radius and virial concentration. 
Determine the scaling behavior with radius at r<< r_s or r>> r_s (see NFW.png)
Change the virial concentration - what happens to the profile?  
Change the virial mass - what happens to the profile?
